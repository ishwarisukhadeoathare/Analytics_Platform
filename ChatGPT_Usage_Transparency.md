## ChatGPT Usage Transparency

ChatGPT was used as a development assistant to:
- Validate system architecture decisions
- Clarify real-time WebSocket design patterns
- Review quantitative analytics approaches
- Improve documentation clarity
- Draft README and project explanations

Example prompts included:
- “Design a FastAPI backend for real-time market analytics”
- “Explain hedge ratio and Z-score for statistical arbitrage”
- “How should frontend and backend communicate using WebSockets?”

All code implementation, debugging, testing, and integration decisions were performed manually by the author.
